Learn the essential programming concepts of variables, operators, and data types.

What is programming? --collaboration b/w humans and computers.


    Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
    Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.

//VARIABLES 

variable --> repetition 

When we use a value without assigning it to a variable, that’s known as hardcoding. While it’s sometimes faster to initially hardcode values in your program, in the long run you’ll run into trouble — especially if you need to change what those values are. 

Variables allow us to store information
Variables allow us to quickly reuse a value in our program.
Variables let us easily change a value in our program

//Data Types

Learn about data types, the building blocks of programming. 

In programming, there’s a special group of data types called primitives. Primitives are the most basic data types, so basic that you can find them in pretty much every programming language. They include:

    Numbers
    Strings
    Boolean values (True or False)

FORTRAN. Its name stands for FORmula TRANslating system.

Grace Hopper wrote the first compiler, A-0 

In 1958, John McCarthy of MIT created the LISt Processing (or LISP) language.
